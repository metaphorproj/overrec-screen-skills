description: Use OverRec CLI to take screenshots, record a screen region to GIF/MP4, draw overlay rectangles, list monitors, find windows by title, or snap any app window to an exact position and size. Trigger when the user asks to screenshot a region, record a screen recording/clip/GIF/video, highlight/overlay an area, move/resize a window, fit a window to a rectangle, find a window by name, or capture what's on screen.
allowed-tools: Bash

You have access to OverRec CLI to control screen overlays, screenshots, and window placement.

## Environment

This skill runs on **Windows or WSL**. [OverRec](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pdn41kpj3hg) must be installed and on the PATH.

- **Windows powershell**: use `OverRec.exe`
- **WSL**: use `pwsh.exe -C OverRec.exe` or `powershell.exe -C OverRec.exe`

**Check OverRec is available before running any command:**
```bash
OverRec.exe cli monitors 2>/dev/null || echo "OverRec not found"
```
If not found, inform the user that OverRec must be installed and on the PATH (or provide the full path if known).

---

## Available Commands

**List monitors:**
```
OverRec.exe cli monitors
OverRec.exe cli monitors --all
```

**Draw an overlay rectangle** (stays on top until timeout or closed):
```
OverRec.exe cli draw --location X,Y --size WxH [--color COLOR] [--monitor N] [--timeout SECONDS]
```
Colors: `red`, `green`, `blue`, `yellow`, `white`, `black`, or `#RRGGBB` hex. Default is blue.

**Take a screenshot:**
```
OverRec.exe cli screenshot --location X,Y --size WxH [--output FILE.png] [--no-clipboard] [--monitor N]
```
By default the image is copied to the clipboard. Use `--output` to also save to file. Use `--no-clipboard` to skip clipboard.

**Record a screen region to GIF or MP4:**
```
OverRec.exe cli record --location X,Y --size WxH --output FILE.gif|FILE.mp4 --timeout SECONDS [--fps N] [--monitor N] [--ffmpeg PATH] [--async]
```
- `--timeout SECONDS` is required — recording stops and the file is finalized after this many seconds.
- `--fps N` — constant frame rate, 1-240 (default 10).
- `.gif` output uses the built-in encoder (max size 65535x65535). `.mp4` output requires FFmpeg: by default `ffmpeg` from PATH, or pass `--ffmpeg PATH` for a specific executable.
- On Windows, MP4 recording uses DXGI Desktop Duplication; the recording region must fit entirely within one (non-rotated) monitor.
- Without `--async`, the command blocks until the timeout elapses, then prints `Recording saved: FILE`.
- With `--async`, it starts a detached background worker and returns immediately, printing `Recording started in background (PID N): FILE`. The file is finalized when the timeout elapses, not when the command returns.

**Find a window by title keyword:**
```
OverRec.exe cli window [--all] [<keyword...>]
```
Lists visible windows whose title contains all given keywords (case-insensitive). Omit keywords to list every visible window.

- Default: compact ID/title table
- `--all`: also shows monitor number, location, and size (`max`/`min` for maximised/minimised)

Output format (default):
```
WindowID        Title
------------------------------------------------------------
657846          Google Chrome
329812          Visual Studio Code
```

Output format (`--all`):
```
WindowID        Mon   Location          Size          Title
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
657846          0     0,0               1920x1080     Google Chrome
329812          0     max               1920x1080     Visual Studio Code
131070          1     1920,0            1280x720      Notepad
```

**Snap a window to an exact position and size:**
```
OverRec.exe cli snap --windowid ID --location X,Y --size WxH [--monitor N]
```
- `--windowid` — from `overrec cli window`
- `--location` / `--size` — in absolute screen coordinates, or relative to a monitor origin when `--monitor` is given
- DWM shadow margins are corrected automatically; the visible frame lands exactly at the requested rect
- The window is restored (if minimised/maximised) and brought to the front

## How to Handle User Requests

### "Take a screenshot of [area/region]"
1. If monitor layout is unknown, run `OverRec.exe cli monitors` first.
2. Determine or ask for X, Y, width, height.
3. Run screenshot command. Use `--output FILE.png` to save to disk; add `--no-clipboard` to skip clipboard copy.
4. Report the saved file path (or confirm it was copied to clipboard).

### "Highlight / draw an overlay on [area]"
1. Determine coordinates and size.
2. Run draw command. Use `--timeout` if the user wants it temporary.
3. Inform the user the overlay is active and how to dismiss it.

### "Record a screen recording / clip / GIF / video of [area]"
1. If monitor layout is unknown, run `OverRec.exe cli monitors` first.
2. Determine coordinates, size, and recording duration (`--timeout` is required).
3. Pick the output format from the file extension the user wants: `.gif` (no extra dependencies) or `.mp4` (requires FFmpeg — check with `ffmpeg -version`, or ask the user for `--ffmpeg PATH` if it's not on PATH).
4. Run the record command. Use `--async` if the user wants control returned immediately while recording continues in the background.
5. Report the saved file path once finalized (or the background PID for `--async`).

```bash
# Blocking: waits 10s, then reports the saved file
OverRec.exe cli record --location 0,0 --size 1280x720 --output capture.gif --timeout 10

# MP4 at 30fps, recorded in the background
OverRec.exe cli record --location 0,0 --size 1920x1080 --output capture.mp4 --timeout 15 --fps 30 --async
```

### "Search for a window / find window ID by name"
```bash
OverRec.exe cli window <keyword>
OverRec.exe cli window --all <keyword>   # also shows monitor, location, size
OverRec.exe cli window                  # list all visible windows
```
- Parse the output: skip the header (first 2 lines), then each line has `WindowID` (first field) and `Title` (rest).
- If no match, report that no window was found with that keyword.
- If multiple matches, show the list and ask the user which one to use.

Example — extract the first matching WindowID in bash:
```bash
WIN_ID=$(OverRec.exe cli window chrome | awk 'NR>2 && $1~/^[0-9]+$/ {print $1; exit}')
```

### "Snap / fit / move [app] into a rectangle"
Full workflow — search for the window then snap it:
```bash
# 1. Find the window
OverRec.exe cli window <keyword>

# 2. Snap it (use the WindowID from step 1)
OverRec.exe cli snap --windowid ID --location X,Y --size WxH

# 3. Optionally draw a brief overlay to confirm placement
OverRec.exe cli draw --location X,Y --size WxH --timeout 2
```

Combined one-liner (bash):
```bash
WIN_ID=$(OverRec.exe cli window chrome | awk 'NR>2 && $1~/^[0-9]+$/ {print $1; exit}')
OverRec.exe cli snap --windowid "$WIN_ID" --location 0,0 --size 1280x720
```

If `$WIN_ID` is empty, the window was not found — report this to the user.

### "Arrange windows side by side / tile windows"
1. List monitors: `OverRec.exe cli monitors --all`
2. Find each window by keyword.
3. Calculate tile rectangles from monitor dimensions.
4. Snap each window.

Example — split two windows left/right on a 1920×1080 primary monitor:
```bash
LEFT_ID=$(OverRec.exe cli window chrome  | awk 'NR>2 && $1~/^[0-9]+$/ {print $1; exit}')
RIGHT_ID=$(OverRec.exe cli window notepad | awk 'NR>2 && $1~/^[0-9]+$/ {print $1; exit}')
OverRec.exe cli snap --windowid "$LEFT_ID"  --location 0,0   --size 960x1080
OverRec.exe cli snap --windowid "$RIGHT_ID" --location 960,0 --size 960x1080
```

### "Watch / monitor [area] of the screen"
Implement a watch loop: repeatedly capture the region at an interval and save each frame.

```bash
INTERVAL=5
LOCATION="0,0"
SIZE="640x480"
OUTPUT_DIR="watch_output"
mkdir -p "$OUTPUT_DIR"
i=0
while true; do
    TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
    OverRec.exe cli screenshot --location "$LOCATION" --size "$SIZE" \
        --output "$OUTPUT_DIR/frame_${TIMESTAMP}.png" --no-clipboard
    echo "Captured frame $i at $TIMESTAMP"
    i=$((i+1))
    sleep "$INTERVAL"
done
```

Ask the user:
- What area to watch (coordinates + size, or ask them to describe the region)
- How often to capture (default: every 5 seconds)
- Where to save frames (default: `./watch_output/`)
- Stop condition: number of frames, duration, or manual stop

---

## Coordinate Tips
- Top-left of primary monitor is 0,0.
- For secondary monitors, use `OverRec.exe cli monitors --all` to find each monitor's `Abs Position`, then pass `--monitor N` so `--location` coordinates are relative to that monitor's origin.
- If the user describes a region vaguely ("top-right quarter of screen"), query monitors first to calculate coordinates.
